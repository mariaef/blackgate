This chapter explains the technologies that make the \textit{Distributed
Hosting Engine} possible. Most notable the concept of \textit{Blockchains} for
the distributed management and self-organization of pages and \textit{Tor
Hidden Services} that not only protect the privacy of all involved parties,
but that also allows to host pages behind NATs and Firewalls.

\section{Blockchain}\index{Blockchain}

\textit{Blockchain} is a rather new concept, with a lot of potential. A
\textit{Blockchain} is a distribute ledgers that prevents double spending without a central authority. The first time the \textit{Blockchain} was mentioned and implemented was for Bitcoin \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}.

\section{Tor Hidden Services}\index{Tor Hidden Services}

Tor hidden services are generally used to host pages anonymously and protect
visitors and hosters alike. In the scope of this whitepaper tor hidden
services are used to enable hosting from everywhere, no matter if the device
is behind a NAT or a Firewall. This allows to host pages from public wireless
hotspots, from the office or from home. Without the possibility to abstract
away from public accessible IPs and the capability to circumvent Firewalls it
would not be possible to develop real distributed hosting on end-user devices.
