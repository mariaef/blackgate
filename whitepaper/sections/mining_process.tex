\textbf{Note:} \textit{This section is work in progress. The resulting
description is a first naive solution. Currently in discussion are multi-
entity ownerships and a consensus network between this small group of page
owners, e.g. with Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
\cite{castro1999practical}.}

By definition each page in the hosting space has an own blockchain. In the
\textit{Genesis Block} the \textit{Content Creator} proofs ownership of this
blockchain and hence the related page. The assumption here is that only the
\textit{Content Creator} can update the page and that (s)he is the only entity
that has not intention to compromise the own page.
