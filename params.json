{"name":"Blackgate","tagline":"A project that introduces a decentralized, mobile and private communication network.","body":"# Black Gate - Mobile Deep Web Hidden Services\r\n\r\nA project that introduces a decentralized, mobile and private communication network.\r\n\r\nThe main goal is to build a technical framework that lets users host there own\r\nservices on there mobile devices. By allowing everybody to host services, an user can\r\ndirectly connect to the device of another user, e.g. Jabber/Xmpp or IRC chat, without\r\ngoing over an intermediate, e.g. facebook or gmail chat. Currently this project is\r\nonly a proof-of-concept based on current technologies, protocols and services. In the\r\nfuture it is possible that a dedicated application or protocol will be developed, in\r\norder to support this goal.\r\n\r\nWrite a short e-mail to **blackgate@riseup.net** if you are interested in this project.\r\nThis motivates to push this project further and to publish the current results. Please\r\nfeel also free to send improvements or start a discussion about the project. We are eager\r\nto get your feedback.\r\n\r\n## Security & Privacy Measurements\r\n\r\nThe following measurements apply partially to the general infrastructure and partially to the hosted IRC server.\r\n\r\n* Only accessible via TOR Hidden Service\r\n* Separated .onion address for each client; protected with authentication cookie in stealth mode\r\n* Server runs in a separate FreeBSD Jail inside a VirtualBox instance\r\n* Optional SSL encryption with well known fingerprint for MITM prevention\r\n* No content logging and highly recommended use of OTR encryption\r\n* Only temporary accessible and only for a selected, trusted group\r\n* Server is on-the-go and changes physical location\r\n* No local and remote OPER access, to prevent admin right escalations\r\n* Deactivated CTCP commands\r\n* Enhanced privacy, e.g. no idle times, no part/quit messages, no /whowas\r\n* Each client has the same internal IP address and even that IP is masked\r\n* No services and no bots, less code is more and prevents logging by third parties\r\n\r\n## Security Layers\r\n\r\n    |-------------------------|\r\n    |   Host System with TOR  |   Service encapsulation with different .onion\r\n    |-------------------------|   addresses and explicit NAT port forwarding\r\n        |               ^\r\n        v               |\r\n    |-------------------------|\r\n    |   VirtualBox FreeBSD    |   Portable and hardened virtual base system\r\n    |-------------------------|   inside a VirtualBox instance\r\n        |               ^\r\n        v               |\r\n    |-------------------------|\r\n    |   (IRC) Service Jail    |   Encapsulated daemons inside internal\r\n    |-------------------------|   virtual instances\r\n\r\n## Encryption Layers\r\n\r\n           |-------------------------|\r\n    Client | Optional OTR Encryption |   Client-to-Client (Highly recommended)\r\n           |-------------------------|   aka.

OTR is alone\r\n    your responsibility and has to be used on both sides of the conversation. Also\r\n    without using SSL you are pretty save, the same is not true for missing OTR.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
